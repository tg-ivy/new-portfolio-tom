# Portfolio of Work

## Description

Welcome to my portfolio of work. This project will be added to and altered as I udate it with improved projects that focus more heavily on React and APIs. This project is live deployed on Git Pages. The live deployment can be viewed [here](https://tg-ivy.github.io/new-portfolio-tom/). (As it stands, GitHub pages is not working and throws a 404 error due to react router.) Below is an attached screenshot.
